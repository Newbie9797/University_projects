    "\n",
    "* Investigate historic demand and assume a probability distribution that fits the data\n",
    "* Use that probability distribution to generate demands for the simulation horizon\n",
    "* Develop a simulation program for inventory system with a (*R* = 1, *S*) policy: a periodic inventory review policy in which we order up to the order-up-to level (OUL) *S* every *R* units of time (see picture below). The inventory level should cover the demand during the review period *R* and the lead time. Please note that in this case, inventory holdings costs then to be higher than for continuous review inventory systems.\n",
    "* Optimize the parameter *S*.\n",
    "* Simulate an (*R*, *s*, *S*) policy (picture given in part 5). In this policy, we order up to our OUL *S* only when the inventory level is lower than our re-order point (ROP) *s*.\n",

Comparing the costs of OUL = 100 and OUL = 200, we see that the costs decrease, so setting OUL = 200 is more beneficial. However, even though OUL = 400 results in better alpha and beta values, our costs increase as well. So, we need to find the best value of S for our total costs."
